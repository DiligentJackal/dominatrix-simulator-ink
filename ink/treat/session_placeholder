Welcome, {isBoy:boy|{isGirl:girl|pet}}!
I'm so pleased to see you!

For your first official therapy session,
I'd think we should help you get into 
the right headspace.

There's nothing quite like dropping you 
into subspace to really enhance our pleasure.

Would you like that, {isBoy:boy|{isGirl:girl|pet}}?

+ [yes]
    -> Treat_AcknowledgeYes ->
    
+ [no]
    Hrm.
    Are you sure you want to be here?
    
    ++ [yes]
        Then you are willing to continue?
        
        +++ [yes]
            -> Treat_AcknowledgeYes ->
            
        +++ [no]
            -> Treat_Unhappy ->
            Come back when you are ready.
            -> exit
    ++ [no]
        Very well.
        I suggest you return another time.
        -> exit
            
- Have you ever experience subspace before?

+ [yes]
    Then I will be curious to know
    whether this session works for you.
    
+ [no]
    Then I have my work cut out for me!
    We will evaluate how well this works
    when we are finished.

+ [yes]

- Before we begin,
close your eyes 
and take a deep cleansing breath.

//inhale and exhale audio

Again.

//inhale and exhale audio

Feel the solid ground beneath your feet.
Let your arms hang loosely at your sides.

Now.
Breathe in deeply as you raise your shoulders up to your ears,
then exhale as you let your shoulders sink down.

-> Treat_GoodJob ->

Open your eyes.
Look at me.
Do not take your eyes off me 
until I tell you to do so.

Understand?

+ [yes]
    -> Treat_GoodJob ->

+ [no]
    If you choose to defy my instructions,
    then you will get no benefit from this session.
    
    Will you keep your eyes on me?
    
    ++ [yes]
        -> Treat_AcknowledgeYes ->
        
    ++ [no]
        -> Treat_Unhappy ->
        Very well.
        I suggest you return another time.
        -> exit

- I see you.
In your eyes, I see a soul who yearns for a place.
For a home.
To belong.

I see you.

Kneel, {isBoy:boy|{isGirl:girl|pet}}.

+ [pose:kneel]

+ [timeout]

- Right now,
in this moment,
you are with me.

I see you.

I see the gentle curve of your head.
The soft swell of your lips.
The {isBoy:smooth lines of your chest|succulent ripeness of your breasts.}

Do you feel my eyes on you, {isBoy:boy|{isGirl:girl|pet}}?

+ [yes]
    -> Treat_GoodJob ->

+ [no]
    You will.
    
- Breathe, {isBoy:boy|{isGirl:girl|pet}}.
In and out.

//inhale and exhale sound

-> Treat_GoodJob ->

Just like that.

Keep your eyes on mine, little one.

I see the sumptuous fall of your belly.
The strong lines of your thighs.
The delicate bend of your fingers.

I see you.

Raise your arms above your head.
Expose yourself to me, little one.

+ [pose:present_kneel]
+ [timeout]

- -> Treat_GoodJob ->

So beautiful.
So perfect.
Just where I want you.

Breathe, little one.

//inhale and exhale sound
