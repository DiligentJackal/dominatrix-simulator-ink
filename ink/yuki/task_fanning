// She's excited to be pampered and says it's her favorite part of being a Mistress.
// She says that she's going to take a break from standing and giving everyone else help and let someone else take care of her.
// She leads the player over to a sitting area and rests back on the couch.
// There are different items already laid out in the room around her, on the table, on another chair, or the wall: a fan, bowl of grapes, boot polish, hair brush (I really want this one!)
// She has the player alternate between different tasks to serve her, which can be randomized, with different comments (like your edging scene).
// Every now and then, between tasks, she has the player pause and stroke themself, because slaves are supposed to stay hard / wet (but really because she likes it).
// The scene wraps with her kissing the player's head and telling them they have done a very good job helping her relax, but now she has to go back to her job!
// “The worst thing about working is how much of a sweat I build up. You wouldn’t think a little body like mine could sweat so much, but it can!”

// “Why don’t you help me cool off, huh?”

// But first, let’s set the mood!

// Universal Break 

// “Okay, now start fanning! And start kinda [fast / slow]”

// *fans*

// //[A little faster please. | A little slower please.]

// “Oooh yeeeaaah, that is nice.”

// “You know, being a Mistress here can be hard, especially when you’re me! Sometimes I almost feel like one of you slaves!”

// “Heheh, well, I mean, I don’t have to fan myself at least.”

// “But you don’t mind, do you?”

// //Yes -> Well that’s not very nice. You came to me, remember? [Consider looking at other scripts for shared lines]

// //No -> You’re a very good little slave. I like having you around.

// //Timeout ->

// “Why don’t you get on your knees for me”

// Think it’s too hot / install fans?
// Poor little slave. Having to fan me. I should probably install fans, shouldn’t I?
// Ahhhh… I feel so much cooler! Why would I ever install fans when I get to be pampered like this!
