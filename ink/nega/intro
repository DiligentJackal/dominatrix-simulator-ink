Don't worry, pretty {player_name}.
Expect that to happen once in a while.

/perform behold
Walk out one door, expecting to arrive somewhere,
and suddenly find yourself somewhere else.

/perform open_arms_shrug
You get used to it.

- How's that cute little ass of yours?
Does your poor tushy sting?

+[yes]
    That's the Headmistress for you.
    /perform eye_roll
    What a bitch.
+ [no]
    Oh, a touch {isBoy:guy|girl}, huh?
    Nice.
    
- As fun as it might be,
I'm not here about your sore ass.

- (give_reward)

You have something I want.
/perform lean_forward
And you're going to give it to me.
Aren't you?

+ [yes]
    That's right.
    You're going to give me that pretty little Bloodstone
    and I might give you something in return.

+ [no]
    I would think twice about that if I were you.
    Are you sure you don't want to give me that pretty Bloodstone?
    
    ++[yes]
        Stop wasting my time!
        Get out of here.
