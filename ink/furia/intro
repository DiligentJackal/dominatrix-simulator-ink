//player enter room on outside of carefully
//watches a series of slaves doing tasks for a minute or so - during this time, Enforcer Furia is barking out criticisms or commands and whipping a slave at a punishment pole
//she turns to the player to acknowledge them and interrogate them to find out why they are there 
//during the interrogation, the slaves continue their tasks in the background (1 slave in cell sucking on glory hole cock and giving another a hand job, 1 slave sitting in chair bound and softly crying while getting zapped with electrip nipple and genital clamps, 1 slave begging softly to be peed on laying on cold floor near hold in ground, 1 slave tied to punishment pole after being whipped, 1 slave laying on the electrical bed covered in sweat with more electrical clamps attached)

//Scene begins: Furia finishes whipping player

Six. - That's it. Embrace the pain.
Seven. - You were made for this.
Eight. - Feel the heat of each bite of my whip.
Nine. - Let go and accept your place.
Ten. - Ahhh! Your suffering is so delicious and filling!

You have done well, slave.

Your endurance continues to improve.
You are earning my favor.
Keep impressing me and you shall graduate to the next level of training soon.
You have earned your release.

//slave is slumped and panting hard, moaning and gyrating against the pole to orgasm

//Furia turns to player

What have we here?

I see <i>'It'<i> has taken an interest in you.

Opened the way to my chamber of re-programming.

Look around...

Observe what is all around you.

//check to see if the player looks and watches

Each one of these creatures came to me raw and in need of purpose.

The HM... she attempts, in her own misguided way,
to mold our charges into objects of perfection.

Believing they will feed with their pleasure and obedience.

Such a pathetic waist of potential!

I draw out what is truly required to sustain us all.

Raw debasement.

Utter depraviity and suffering.

Wanton objects of suffering who want nothing more than to be flayed open...

Mind and soul.

In time, you will come to want that too.

Won't you?
    Yes - you are already on the right path by arriving here.
    No - Time will tell. They all fall in the end. Given enough time and tempation.
    
Mistress Nega will taunt you and use you, but you will never ahcieve your true prupose with her.

Come to me to be reborn.

Shall I show you? (consent check)
    
     Yes - go to task scene.
     No - You are not ready. Return when you are ready to be useful.
