/perform bored
Don't worry, pretty {player_name}.
Expect that to happen once in a while.

/perform behold
Walk out one door, expecting to arrive somewhere,
and suddenly find yourself somewhere else.
You could think of them as ...
/perform air_quotes
"interlewds", I suppose.

You'll get used to it.

I pulled in a little favor to make sure
that kiss-ass Yuki wasn't paying attention.

    Don't waste your time with that simpering brat.

    No? I'm sure she would have.
    You must be some kind of idiot who doesn't listen.

    Try to play dumb all you want, 
    but you better do what you're fucking told.

Now. You have something I want.
Once you give it to me, it's gone. No take-backsies!
You have to give it to me to play.
Those are the rules.

And I better warn you, I don't always play nice, 
so you better think hard before you give it to me.

What are you going to do, pretty {player_name}?
Do you want to try your luck?

    That's right.
    You're going to give me that lovely little Bloodstone.
