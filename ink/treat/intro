    I see you have failed your first test.
    But you have been given another chance 
    to prove yourself.
    
    - else:
    I see you have passed your first test. 
    You've pleased the Goddess so much,
    <i>She</i> has given you your next challenge.
}

- You'll need to earn a full wrist of rewards, 
10 Bloodstones,
to come out of chastity.

- (challenge)
Are you ready for this challenge?

+ [yes]
    -> Treat_AcknowledgeYes ->
    I believe in you.
    
+ [no]
    -> Treat_Unhappy ->
    It will stay on until you choose to remove it.
    
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> challenge   

+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> challenge

- I <i>know</i> things can get a little intense around here.
Don't give up.
I promise it will be worth your while.
As you know, you have so much potential.

Let me have a good look at you.

- (present)
Put your arms behind your head and spread your legs.

+ [pose:present_stand]
    It's good to see how quickly you comply.
    
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> present


- (confuse)
Tell me, does this place confuse you?

+ [yes]
    Not surprising.
    Things will become more clear in time.
    --(enjoy)
    Have you enjoyed yourself, at least?
    
        ++ [yes]
            Good.
            There is so much pleasure to experience here.
            
            
        ++ [no]
            That is concerning.
            We must be doing something wrong.
        
        ++ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> enjoy
        
        ++ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> enjoy

+ [no]
    I hope it stays that way.
    Things are not always as they seem.
    
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> confuse

+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> confuse

- From now on, things will only get more demanding.
Much will be asked of you.
And, at times, you will struggle.

This is where I come in.
I'm here to keep an eye on your mental health.

To make sure everything... 
And I mean <i>everything</i>...
Stays in good working order.

The mind is key.
It dictates to us what is pleasure and what is pain.

{hasPenis: Cup your cock|Spread your pussy} and present it to me.
 
- (sore)
Is it sore?

+ [yes]
    I thought so.
    Well, you had better get used to the feeling.
    It's going to be used <i>a lot</i>.

+ [no]
    Good.
    Because it's going to be used <i>a lot</i>.

+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> sore
  
+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> sore

I know you're ass has not been tested yet.
But it will.

- (ass)
Let me see it. Turn around and spread your ass.

+ [pose: present_ass_reverse_spread]
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> ass


- Yes. Very nice.
I can tell already that it will be very popular around here.

- (play)
Do you enjoy having your ass played with?

+ [yes]
    I wonder if you will continue to feel that way.
    Time will tell.
        
+ [no]
    Then you had better speak up when a Mistress 
    asks you if you want it to be used.
        
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> play

+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> play
        
- (chest)
Turn back around and show me your chest.

+ [pose: present_chest]
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> chest


- Very pleasing.
I'm sure those tight nubs will be toyed with often.

- (excite)
Does that idea excite you?

+ [yes]
    Mmmm.
    -- (pleasure)
    Do you enjoy teasing them when you pleasure yourself?
    
    ++ [yes]
        What a naughty, little minx.
        
    ++ [no]
        No?
        You should try it sometime.
        
    ++ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> pleasure
    
    ++ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> pleasure
        
+ [no]        
    Well, you're going to have to decide
    how much you can handle.
 
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> excite

+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> excite

- Remember.
The more you serve,
the more valuable you are.

- (relax)
Relax.

+ [pose:stand]
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> relax

- (serve)
Do you find it hard to serve?

+ [yes]
    -> Treat_Unhappy ->
    Then make sure you visit me often.
    I can help with that.
    
+ [no]
    -> Treat_AcknowledgeYes ->
    If you find it easy,
    you may not need to come see me that often.
    Nevertheless...
 
+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> serve

+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> serve
  
- 
My office is just up the stairs to the right.

- (office)
Will you make sure to come see me?

+ [yes]
    -> Treat_AcknowledgeYes ->
    I will keep track of how often you visit.

+ [no]
    -> Treat_Unhappy ->
    If you neglect your mental health, 
    I may have to make visits mandatory.

+ [timeout] -> Treat_Timeout -> office

+ [distracted] -> Treat_PayAttention -> office

- Now... I'm sure you are expected elsewhere.
You can come see me anytime you need someone to take care of you.
I can help you relax,
get into the right headspace,
or soothe you after a hard session.

- (visit)
Do you want to visit me now?

+ [yes]
    Come to my office then.
    -> treat_hub.choose_session
    
+ [no]
    That's fine.
    Visit me when you are ready.
