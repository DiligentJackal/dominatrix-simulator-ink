/Nega stands if not already standing
I want to inspect you.

Stand at attention, whore! Hands behind your head!

    Not good enough! Try again!

So, what do we have here?
Were you hoping to get lucky with me?

/Nega spits on the player's face
Ha! Well it's not your lucky day!

/Nega leans in and whispers in the player's ear
{shuffle:
    - I'll bet you're really horny. I'm going to make sure you stay that way! 
    - No release for you today!
    - Today I'm going to hurt you, and I'm going to enjoy it!
    - You are insignificant. I will use you as I see fit.
    }
    
/Nega backs up
- (present_ass) 
Now, turn around, bend over and present your ass to me!

    +   [Success] -> present_ass_success
    
    +   [Failure]
    That's not right! Try again!

/Nega laughs
You look ridiculous, worm!
Hold that pose for a bit.

/Wait 5
/Nega pulls out a camera (could be a phone)

/Camera shutter noise
There we go! 
It's always good to have a little blackmail material! 
Don't cross me, or who knows where that picture might end up!
Alright, wretch! You are allowed to face me again.
