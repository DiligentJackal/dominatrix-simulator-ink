- /perform squirm
One of my favorite things in the <i>whole world</i> is playing with a puppy. #49
/perform curious
So, I was wondering... #50

- (be_puppy) 
/perform cocks_head_to_left
Is that something you're interested in? #51
Being my puppy? #52
/perform idle_yuki

+ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->
    
+ [no]
    -- (check_again_puppy)
    /perform behold
    Oh, come on. Please? #54
    /perform clasp_hands
    It would make me so happy! #55

    ++ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->
    ++ [no]
        /perform open_arms_shrug
        Well, okay. I don't really have anything else for you then. #56

- /perform bounces
I love having new puppies to play with. #57

/perform lean_forward
<i>Good</i> puppies. #58

/perform idle_yuki
And you can't be a good puppy until you learn how to behave like one. #59

/perform impatient
So pay attention! #60

+ [continue] 
+ [distracted] -> Yuki_PayAttention -> 

- /perform curious
I'm going to teach you to respond to some basic commands first. #61
/perform thoughtful
For now, you're just learning, so I'll ignore any mistakes you make. #62
/perform lean_forward
But eventually, you're going to be tested on what I've taught you! #63

- (remember_pose)
/perform shake_finger
You really, really need to remember this stuff! #64
Okay? #65
/perform idle_yuki

+ [yes]
    /perform nod
    We'll find out how well you do later. #66

+ [no]
    /perform shake_finger_stern
    Then you're going to have a hard time later {isBoy:mister|missy}. #67
    -> Yuki_CheckIfInterested ->

- /notify title="<color=red>Pro Tip!</color>" text="Grab a pillow for your knees! You're going to need it! Got it?"

+ [yes]

- /perform one_finger
Alrighty, time for your first lesson! #68

/perform idle_yuki
When you're not doing anything else, you should <b>"sit"</b> and wait for a command. #69
That should be <i>natural</i> for a puppy! #70

- (puppy_ready)
/perform curious
Ready to learn to <b>"sit"</b>? #71
/perform idle_yuki

+ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->

- (puppy_sit) /perform point_down
Get down on your knees, sit back on your heels,/ #72
and rest your hands on the floor between your thighs. #73

/perform shake_finger_stern
Look forward, not down! #74

+ [pose:puppy_sit]

- (understand_sit)
/perform idle_yuki
Puppies always wait in this position until they are given a new command. #75
Understand? #76

+ [yes] -> Yuki_AcknowledgeYes ->

+ [no]
    -- (ask_sit_again)
    /perform impatient
    Always start in the <b>"sit"</b> position whenever you are a puppy, #77
    then follow commands from there. #78
    
    /perform lean_forward
    Make sense? #79

    ++ [yes] -> Yuki_GoodJob ->

    ++ [no]
        /perform disappointed
        Maybe we should try this some other time. #80
        /perform point_to_leave
        Come back later. #81

+ [distracted] -> Yuki_PayAttention -> understand_sit

- /perform one_finger
Now... #82
Puppies don't nod and shake their head like <i>people</i> do. #83

/perform lean_forward
And you're a cute little puppy, aren't you? #84

- (puppy_yes_intro)

/perform idle_yuki
To say <b>"yes"</b>, raise your right hand...Er, <i>paw</i>... #85
Just an eensy, weensy bit. #86

+ [pose:puppy_yes] -> Yuki_GoodJob ->

- /perform squirm
You're not a boring, old human anymore, are you? #87

/perform idle_yuki
Raise your left paw slightly to say <b>"no"</b>. #88

+ [pose:puppy_no] -> Yuki_GoodJob ->

- /perform clasp_hands
Whenever you visit me as a puppy, #89
I'll make sure you get lots of practice! #90

/perform idle_yuki
Eventually, I'm going to test you on all your commands. #91

/perform bounces
Won't that be so much fun? #92

/perform idle_yuki
Remember to answer like a proper puppy would. #93

+ [pose:puppy_yes]
    /perform bounces
    You're learning so fast! #94
    I can't wait until you're fully trained! #95

+ [pose:puppy_no]
    -- (puppy_reminder)
    /perform disappointed
    I thought puppies were supposed to have good hearing... #97
    First, I teach you new poses. #98
    Then, you practice those poses. #99
    Eventually, I test you on those poses. #100

+ [timeout] -> Yuki_Interested -> puppy_reminder 
    
- /perform squirm
If you do well, I'll reward you for being a good {player_name}. #101
/perform one_finger
Otherwise, I'll have to punish you for being a bad dog. #102

/perform sighs
And puppy punishments are <i>not</i> as fun as puppy rewards. #103

/perform excited
But I'm sure you'll do super well! #104

/perform idle_yuki
That's it for today, puppy. #105
/perform bounces
Come visit me again soon! #106
