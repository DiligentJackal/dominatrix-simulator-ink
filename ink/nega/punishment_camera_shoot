So, what do we have here?
Were you hoping to get lucky with me?

Ha! Well it's not your lucky day!

//Nega leans in and whispers in the player's ear

    - I'll bet you're really horny. 
      I'm going to make sure you stay that way! 
    - No release for you today!
    // - Today I'm going to hurt you, and I'm going to enjoy it!
    - You are insignificant. 
      I will use you as I see fit.

You look ridiculous, worm!
Hold that pose for a bit.

/Wait 5
//Nega pulls out a camera (could be a phone)

//Camera shutter noise
There we go! 
It's always good to have a little blackmail material! 
Don't cross me, or who knows where that picture might end up!
Alright, wretch! You are allowed to face me again.
