Well, well {player_name}. #01
You've only just arrived and already you misbehave. #02
So disappointing. #03

/emotion neutral
There are no secrets in my house. #04
Every soul here must serve. #05
You will be made pleasing #06
or you will cease to be of use. #07

/emotion amused
For your transgressions, you will suffer. #08
Ten Obsidians worth of punishments will do. #09

//give player 10 punishment markers

/emotion angry 20
You will pay them all now! #10
//remove 10 punishment markers with flare 

/emotion neutral
Pleasure will be denied to you until you have proved your worth. #11
Ten Bloodstones will unlock you from your imprisonment. #12
//give chastity device

Now go and fail me no further {player_name}. #13

Hello there, little {player_name}. 
You have performed adquately for one so new.
I am satisfied. For now.

/emotion happy
As always, the Headmistress out does herself.
Her dedication to obedience serves me well.
Restrained passion sustains so much longer 
than a bright flame that burns out too soon.

/emotion amused
I must commend Mistress Yuki-Onna, as well.
It seems her lesson has increased her motivation to focus.

/emotion nuetral
Continue to serve in my house, {player_name}, 
and you remain useful.

/emotion amused
I shall leave you now.
Go forth and please me, {player_name}.
