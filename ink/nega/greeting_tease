Come here and kiss my boot, worm!
Very good, accept your place beneath me. 
Embrace that which will hurt you!

I stepped outside earlier and got the bottoms of my boots dirty.

    - Would you be a dear and clean that up for me with your tongue?

    You're such a dirty whore! I love it! Now get busy!

    You ungrateful loser! Here's a piece of Obsidian.

//The idea here is that the player has to move their head in a "yes"-like motion to "lick" the boot. It would be really tool if there was actually dirt on the boot that disappeared/fell off as the player "licked"

- (lick_1) 
/Player must move head up and down near the bottom of the boot.

    +   [Successful Lick]
    Very good, maggot! Just like that. 
    -> lick_2
    
    +   [Unsuccessful]
    That's not right, cunt! Try again! 
    -> lick_1
    
- (lick_2) You're so disgusting. Keep going!
    +   [Successful Lick]
    Can you believe how lowly you are, worm? 
    You're less important than the dirt beneath my heels. 
    -> switch_feet
    
    +   [Unsuccessful]
    You should know how to do this by now, cunt! Again! 
    - ~ demerits++

- (switch_feet) /Nega switches feet, so the other boot is now in front of the player.

    - Now, for the other boot, scum!
    - Lick it, worm!
    }

    You make a good shoe polisher! 
    Perhaps I'll have you clean out up my shoe closet one of these days. 
    -> lick_4
    
    +   [Unsuccessful]
    My other boot deserves the same attention as the first, bitch! Again!

    - Keep licking, whore!

    You're worthless! 
    - ~ demerits++

- (inspect) /Nega inspects the bottoms of her boots.
If your tongue is this thorough, 
I'll bet it would be useful for other things as well...

Alright, maggot, playtime's over!

/Nega stands if not already standing
I want to inspect you.

Stand at attention, whore! Hands behind your head!

    Not good enough! Try again!

So, what do we have here?
Were you hoping to get lucky with me?

/Nega spits on the player's face
Ha! Well it's not your lucky day!

/Nega leans in and whispers in the player's ear
{shuffle:
    - I'll bet you're really horny. I'm going to make sure you stay that way! 
    - No release for you today!
    - Today I'm going to hurt you, and I'm going to enjoy it!
    - You are insignificant. I will use you as I see fit.
    }
    
/Nega backs up
- (present_ass) 
Now, turn around, bend over and present your ass to me!

    +   [Success] -> present_ass_success

    That's not right! Try again!
    - ~ demerits++ 
    -> present_ass

- (present_ass_success)
/Nega laughs
You look ridiculous, worm!
Hold that pose for a bit.

/Wait 5
/Nega pulls out a camera (could be a phone)

/Camera shutter noise
There we go! 
It's always good to have a little blackmail material! 
Don't cross me, or who knows where that picture might end up!
Alright, wretch! You are allowed to face me again.
