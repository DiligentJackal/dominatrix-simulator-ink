I'm here #02
/wait 1
You're not alone #03
/wait 1
I know it's hard right now #04
/wait 1
And I know it hurts #05
/wait 1
Breathing probably takes a lot of effort #06
/wait 1
It will hurt for a while #07
/wait 1
But it will get better over time #08
/wait 1
Its okay to be sad #09
/wait 1
Its okay to hurt #10
/wait 1
I'll hold you, I'll catch you #11
/wait 1
Anytime you need a hug or snuggles #12
/wait 1
Or just to be held or rocked or soothed. #13
/wait 1
I'll catch you #14
/wait 1
This is what we do for each other, we help people, we take care of people #15
And you don't have to strong right now, I'll help take care of you #16
/wait 1
I've got plenty of strength to share #17
/wait 1
Just breathe #18
/wait 1
Slow deep #19
/wait 1
One breath after the other #20
/wait 1
If tears come with it, it's okay. #21
/wait 1
Let them fall. Let it out. #22
/wait 1
If your heart hurts and you need to sob. #23
/wait 1
Do that. #24
/wait 1
Don't be afraid to feel, don't be afraid to ask for help #25
/wait 1
You're not alone, and i'm here to hold you as much as you need #26
/wait 1
I know i'm just a stranger on the internet but i'm a stranger that can be here for you #27
/wait 1

// this sounds like it could be the start of the scene maybe
I like taking care of people. #28
/wait 1
I like taking care of people when they are small, and they are vulnerable and they are hurting. #29

/wait 1
No body who is hurting should be alone #30
/wait 1
And you don't have to be strong with me because I'll hold you #31
/wait 1
And I'll catch you #32
/wait 1
And I'll keep you safe. #33
/wait 1

I'll protect you with my arms and keep all of the icky world out for a while #34
And you can just hide and you can be safe and warm #35
/wait 1
You can be protected. #36

/wait 1
It will be okay #37
/wait 1
You'll be okay, I promise #38
/wait 1
It won't feel like that right now, it may not feel like that for a long time #39
/wait 1
Sometimes it will feel like it's a little better and then it will come back #40
/wait 1
And you'll want to hide or you'll want to curl up inside #41
/wait 1

Maybe you won't show anybody how you're feeling, #42
/wait 1
But it's okay, its okay to need a place to hide where you're safe and you won't be judged  #43
/wait 1
And you won't be asked to do anything you can't handle #44
/wait 1

Whatever you need to be in the real world for anyone else in your life, be that #45
/wait 1
But just know that when you come find me, when you need to be held #46
/wait 1
When you need to be loved, when you need to be cared for and comforted #47
/wait 1
I'll be here, my arms will be here, my hugs will be here. #48
/wait 1
My warm soothing presence, the safety #49
/wait 1
The acceptance #50
/wait 1
The care #51
/wait 1
I'll hold you. #52
/wait 1
You don't have to fall alone #53
/wait 1
Fall into me #54
/wait 1
Fall into me #55
/wait 1
Just breathe #56
/wait 1
Just be with me right now #57
/wait 1
Let each breath fill your body with cleansing, fresh air #58
/wait 1


Let the breath exit your body, letting all those feelings go with it #59
/wait 1
Because there will more, and you need to let them move through you #60
/wait 1
Just let them wash over you, it's okay they won't be there forever and know that i'm here holding you #61
/wait 1
Rocking you breathing with you #62
/wait 1
Taking all that pain and helping hold it for you, and helping it move through you #63
/wait 1

Giving you my strength, my care, my affection. #64
/wait 1

It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay #65
/wait 1
You re going to be okay #66
/wait 1
Maybe not right away, maybe not right now, but you will, I promise #67
/wait 1
I promise it will get better, I promise the pain will get less strong over time. #68
/wait 1

You're going to fill a hole, that hole inside you is going to feel so deep #69
/wait 1
It's going to feel like it's going to suck you down and you're going to get lost inside it #70
/wait 1
But i promise you won't because i'm there with you every step of the way #71
/wait 1
Holding you as much or as little as you need, you're not walking that path alone.  #72
/wait 1

You're not falling into nothingness i'm there to catch you,  #73
/wait 1

I'm there to hold you, i'm there to take some of that pain for you #74
/wait 1
Give it to me, let it go, let me have it for a while. #75
/wait 1
You don't have to carry this burden alone, you're not alone. #76
/wait 1
//the word 'anytime' has an awkward pause. Could use a sound edit to see if the pause can be removed
I will be here, anytime you need. #77
/wait 1
Breathe #78
/wait 1

When the pain is that strong it feels like our entire body is in a knot #79
/wait 1
When your heart is so tiny gripped in a vice of pain listen to my voice. #80
/wait 1
//this line has a heavy blowign over the microphone sound that distorts it
And breathe.  #81
/wait 1

That's all you have to do right now #82
/wait 1
All you have to do is breathe #83
/wait 1
//there is a verbal stutter in this line. maybe it can be removed with editing
You don't have to do anything else, you don't have to take care of anybody else right now in this moment. #84
/wait 1
All you have to do is breathe. #85
/wait 1

Let me hold you #86
/wait 1
Let me give you my strength #87
/wait 1
You can go back and be strong for others later #88
/wait 1
But right now this is your time #89
/wait 1
And i'm here #90
/wait 1
Holding you, #91
/wait 1
Comforting you, #92
/wait 1
Taking care of you #93
/wait 1

Be little. #94
/wait 1
Be tired #95
/wait 1
Be sad #96
/wait 1
Whatever you need to feel #97
/wait 1
Its okay #98
/wait 1
You're going to be okay #99
/wait 1
I promise #100
/wait 1

I promise it will get better #101
/wait 1
I promise you're not alone #102
/wait 1
I promise i will be here #103
/wait 1
Anytime you need to be held #104
/wait 1
You know where i am, come to me when you need me #105
/wait 1
I will catch you #106
/wait 1
I will give you my strength #107
/wait 1
I will hold you, i will care for you #108
/wait 1

//another heavy breathing over mic that distorts sound
Breathe #109

You are not alone, I am here. #110
