//pragma loves beautiful things - her gallery is filled with her creations of perfection
//pragma seeks to perfect you and add you to her collection

//Player enters scene in one of the statue cubbies around the outer edge of the room
//Pragma has a slave on a table on the main platform and circles around them, leaning forward to inspect various parts of the body

You are almost ready.

Acheiving perfection is a process that must not be rushed.
Just a few more modifications... yes.
The legs... still too short.
Hrm... yes... the breasts must be firmer.
A few more sessions.
I am pleased.
I will soon be able to add her to my collection.

//pragma stops and looks up and away

I must reflect further.
Time for my next restoration project.

//scene reloads with the slave gone and the player standing before pragma

What an interesting new specimen.


//malfunctioning machine


//after preview of Pragma with slave, scene reloads with player in the center of the platform - they are now a posable doll
//Pragma makes the player hold various positions for long durations while she inspects them
//if the player moves out of position, she throws them out and comments on them as an inferior specimen
//during posing, she refers to the player as 'it', as if recording a clinical experiment, commenting on their numerous deficiencies and flaws, talking about them as if they are not conscious or aware
//Dialogue would be her talking to herself, formulating a repair plan or disassembly procedure to break them down into individual components and rebuild them into a 'drone of perfection'
//speaking manner influenced by 7 or 9 or Borg
