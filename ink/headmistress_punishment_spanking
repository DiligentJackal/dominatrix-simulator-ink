/character crowd cheers

Welcome esteemed friends!
As always, purrs, moans, and words of encouragement
are permitted during the punishment lesson.

Our subject today has earned a spanking.

I will use a paddle made of mahogany.
An excellent, hard wood ideal for leaving
bright red welts on the flesh of disobedient slaves.
Would you not agree?
/character crowd coos 

Listen to the excitement {player_name}.
Your ass will provide a fine demonstration today.

Are they not fortunate to have one such as you to observe?
+[yes]
~obey++
Perform well and your punishment marker will be removed.

+[no]
~obey--
It is a shame you do not value the learning of others.

- Prepare yourself, {player_name}.
/character headmistress paddle_ass
//check to see if they respond and give positive or negative feedback

//(random nuetral for each swat) A fine welt is forming.; Music to my ears.; Perhaps I should be counting.; A red bottom is a pleasing bottom.; I do so love instructing slaves in proper behavior.; I never tire of this.; I suspect that one hurt.

//random sexual: Notice how the {isBoy:shaft bounces|nether lips clench}.; The light is catching the dewy sheen on the skin most magnificently.; Observe the {isBoy: tip|slit} begin to glisten.
