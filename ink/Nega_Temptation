Don't worry, pretty {player_name}.
Expect that to happen once in a while.

/perform behold
Walk out one door, expecting to arrive somewhere,
and suddenly find yourself somewhere else.

/perform open_arms_shrug
You get used to it.

+[wait]

You have something I want.
/perform lean_forward
And you're going to give it to me.
Aren't you?

- (give_reward)
+[yes]
That's right.
You're going to give me that reward marker
and I might give you something in return.

+[no]
I would think twice about that if I were you.
Are you sure you don't want to give me your reward marker?
    ++[yes]
    Stop wasting my time!
    Get out of here.
    
    ++[no]
    Very good. 
    I can be a lot of fun with the right guest.
    
+[timeout]
Well, do you want to be used and abused?
