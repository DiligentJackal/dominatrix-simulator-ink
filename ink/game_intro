Lighting flashes and you see a devilish figure locked in a sexual exchange with two other figures, moaning filling your ears. The lightning flashes again, filling your eyes with a new, this time, tortuous exchange. Again, it flashes, and you find those same figures in a new embrace - each scene wildly different from one another. Without warning, the storm abates, the lightning ceases, and before you stands a Goddess.</i></blockquote>
