/character nega bored
Don't worry, pretty {player_name}.
Expect that to happen once in a while.

/character nega behold
Walk out one door, expecting to arrive somewhere,
and suddenly find yourself somewhere else.

/character nega open_arms_shrug
You'll get used to it.

/character nega sassy
I pulled in a little favor to make sure
that kiss-ass Yuki wasn't paying attention.

//if the player had the Yuki ending, add this part
-(yuki_warning)

I bet she told you not talk to me, didn't she?

+[yes]
    Don't waste your time with that simpering brat.
    Oh sure, she'll be all sweet and attentive,
    but she'll bore the shit out of you eventually.
    Stick with me if you really want to have some fun.
    
+[no]
    No? I'm sure she would have.
    You must be some kind of idiot who doesn't listen.
    Don't pull that shit with me.
    You can be as dumb as a rock, 
    but you better do what you're fucking told.
    
+[timeout]
    Well?

//if the player had the nega ending, start here
- How's that cute little ass of yours?
Does your poor tushy sting?

+[yes]
    That's the Headmistress for you.
    /perform eye_roll
    What a bitch.
+ [no]
    Oh, a tough {isBoy:guy|girl}, huh?
    Nice.
    
- Turn around and bend over.
Grab those ankles and let me see for myself.

- (present_ass)
//have player present ass before she gets them to give up their stone 
- My, my. Your ass turns a nice shade of pink.
She made a good lesson out of you.
Wiggle it for me.
//check to see if the headset wiggles?


- (check_reward)

You have something I want.
/perform lean_forward
And you're going to give it to me.
Aren't you?

+ [yes]
    That's right.
    You're going to give me that pretty little Bloodstone
    and I might give you something in return.
    -> nega_reward_dice.give_reward

+ [no]
    I would think twice about that if I were you.
    Are you sure you don't want to give me that pretty Bloodstone?
    
    ++[yes]
        Stop wasting my time!
        Get the fuck out of here.
        -> exit
    
    ++[no]
        Very good. 
        I can be a lot of fun with the right...toy.

    Well. Are you going to give me what I want?
